To solve the "Contiguous Array" problem using a two-pointer approach in Java without a map, you can try a technique that involves scanning through the array with a sliding window approach. However, this problem is typically solved efficiently using a map (hashmap) to store the first occurrence of the difference between the number of 0s and 1s. Without using a map, it becomes difficult to track the balance efficiently.

Let's attempt a two-pointer approach without a map. The idea is to count the number of 0s and 1s as we traverse the array and try to identify valid subarrays (subarrays that have an equal number of 0s and 1s). We'll adjust the sliding window accordingly.

Here's a sample Java implementation using the two-pointer technique without a map:

public class Solution {
    public int findMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        for (int left = 0; left < nums.length; left++) {
            int count0 = 0, count1 = 0;
            for (int right = left; right < nums.length; right++) {
                // Count 0s and 1s
                if (nums[right] == 0) {
                    count0++;
                } else {
                    count1++;
                }

                // If we have equal number of 0s and 1s, update the max length
                if (count0 == count1) {
                    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
Explanation:
Outer Loop (left pointer): This loop starts from the left of the array and moves one element at a time.
Inner Loop (right pointer): This loop checks the subarray from the left pointer to the right pointer, counting the number of 0s and 1s.
Counting: For each subarray, we maintain the count of 0s (count0) and 1s (count1). Whenever the counts are equal, we update the maximum length.
Time Complexity: This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because of the nested loops, which might not be as efficient as the typical O(n) solution using a hashmap.
Key Limitations:
Efficiency: This approach is not as efficient as using a hashmap, especially when the input array is large, as it has quadratic time complexity.
No Map: This approach explicitly avoids the use of a hashmap, but using one would reduce the time complexity to linear (O(n)).
